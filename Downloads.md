# Introduction #

Google Code has removed the capability to provide downloads for software on its site. Additionally, I have (shamefully) not been using any source code control system like git or subversion.

Now I am motivated to do so.

# Source Code #

Source is now maintained by Git. Source code has been moved to Github. See https://github.com/GreyGnome/ooPinChangeInt.

# Downloads #
A zip file of the latest release(s) can be found at https://bintray.com/greygnome/generic/ooPinChangeInt . Look at the Versions section to find the files to download. In there, look at the Files link. 1.06-rc2 is here: https://bintray.com/version/files/greygnome/generic/ooPinChangeInt/1.06-rc2
